What is there
=============

I shamelessly took the code from the excellent [python tutorial of OpenTechSchool](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/python-beginners)
in order to have a bunch of scripts to run in order to get the trainees interested at @CoderDojoLu.

Not sure it worth a merge upstream as it is hacjked around to show what one can do.
